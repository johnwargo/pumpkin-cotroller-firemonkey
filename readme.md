# Pumpkin Controller (FireMonkey)

This is a cross-platform native version of my Pumpkin Controller app created using [Embarcadero RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio/fm-application-platform) and [FireMonkey](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio/fm-application-platform).

The application allows you to control the [Glowing Pumpkin Server (HTTP)](https://github.com/johnwargo/glowing-pumpkin-server-http) from a native application on Windows, macOS, Android and whatever else FireMonkey supports.
